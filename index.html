                <p>
                    For the majority of my youth, I grew up in Jefferson City Missouri where I graduated from public High School. I then went on to attend Merrell University where I studied Esthetics. After working in spas for a few years, I switched my focus to the more
                    stable career of banking. It was at this point in my life that I was introduced to the idea of careers in the technology field. I would spend all day helping business clients set up, access, and use the banks various online features
                    to help their businesses grow. However, the real fun happened for me after the phone calls stopped for the day, that's when I worked with our developers to set up the new clients, talk about how to better our systems, breakdown how
                    it all worked, and brainstorm how we would be on the cutting edge of banking technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to 10 years later; this is how time works for everyone right? I'm finally pursuing my dream of having a career as a developer. Front end? Back end? How about full stack! This is my current path while attending Washington University Coding
                    Boot Camp. Checkout my portfolio page to see the projects I have done and what is coming next! Like what you see or have a fun project idea? Use my contact page to send me a message! Dreams grow and transform just like the projects
                    you will see here.

                    When I am not applying the "ABC - Always Be Coding" philosophy one of my classmates so cleverly modified from "Glengarry Glen Ross", you can find me with my husband, two bonus babies, and five fur babies enjoying the splendors of being at home. Catching
                    up on the latest episode of "The Mandalorian", playing "Assassin's Creed", expanding my ridiculous makeup collection, watching every movie known to man, or enjoying our wooded back yard are some of my favorite pastimes.
